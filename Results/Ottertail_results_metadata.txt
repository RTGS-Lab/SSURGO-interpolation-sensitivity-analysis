- aws0_12_l20 : A given parcel's available water storage value, calculated via area weighted average with the "Less than 20%" heuristic exception applied (if a soil type occupies less than 20% of a parcel's area, discard soil type from final parcel area weighted average calculation), at the soil-depth interval of 0-12in.

- aws12_24_l20 : A given parcel's available water storage value, calculated via area weighted average with the "Less than 20%" heuristic exception applied (if a soil type occupies less than 20% of a parcel's area, discard soil type from final parcel area weighted average calculation), at the soil-depth interval of 12-24in.
